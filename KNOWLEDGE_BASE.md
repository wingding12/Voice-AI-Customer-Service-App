## 💵 BILLING

### Understanding Your Utility Bill

Your utility bill includes several components:

**Basic Service Charge**: A fixed monthly fee ($12.50 for residential, $25.00 for commercial) that covers meter reading, billing, and customer service.

**Energy Charges**: Based on your actual usage measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) for electricity or therms for natural gas. Rates vary by time of use and season.

**Delivery Charges**: Covers the cost of maintaining power lines, pipes, and distribution infrastructure.

**Taxes & Fees**: State and local taxes, plus regulatory fees.

**How to Read Your Meter**: Your meter displays cumulative usage. We subtract last month's reading from this month's to calculate usage.

For billing questions, customers can view detailed usage history in their online account or call customer service.

## 📊 METERS

### Smart Meter Information

**About Smart Meters**:
Smart meters provide two-way communication between your home and our systems, enabling:

- Automatic meter readings (no more estimated bills)
- Real-time usage monitoring
- Faster outage detection and restoration
- Time-of-use rate options

**Accessing Your Data**:

- Log in to your online account
- View hourly, daily, and monthly usage
- Compare to previous periods
- Set usage alerts

**Common Questions**:

_Are smart meters safe?_
Yes. Smart meters emit low-level radio frequency (RF) signals, far below FCC limits—less than a cell phone.

_Will my bill increase?_
No. Smart meters measure the same as traditional meters. Some customers see changes because estimates are replaced with actual readings.

_Can I opt out?_
Yes, but a $75 opt-out fee and $25/month manual reading fee apply.

**High Usage Alerts**: Set alerts to notify you when usage exceeds a threshold to avoid bill surprises.
